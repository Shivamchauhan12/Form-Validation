Form Validation Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Welcome to the Form Validation project! This project demonstrates how to create a simple and effective form validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this project, you can ensure that user input is accurate and adheres to your specified criteria, enhancing the user experience and data integrity.


Introduction
Form validation is an essential part of web development, especially when it comes to collecting and processing user input. This project showcases a client-side validation approach to enhance data quality before it even reaches the server. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we've created an interactive and user-friendly experience for your website visitors.

Features
Real-time Validation: Users receive instant feedback as they fill out the form, making it easy to correct errors.
Custom Validation Rules: You can define and enforce custom validation rules tailored to your application's needs.
Interactive Design: A user-friendly interface provides clear feedback, ensuring a smooth form submission process.
Prevent Invalid Data: Avoid storing invalid or incorrect data in your database.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Fill out the form, and the validation system will provide real-time feedback on the data you input.
The system will inform you if any of your inputs are invalid according to the defined rules.
Make necessary corrections, and once all inputs are valid, you can submit the form.
Feel free to explore the code in the project files to understand how the validation is implemented. Customize the validation rules to suit your specific requirements.
